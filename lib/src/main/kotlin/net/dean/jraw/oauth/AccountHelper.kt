/**
 * This class aims to make the lives of Android and web developers a bit easier when handling switching between
 * accounts and in to/out of userless mode.
 *
 * Think of AccountHelper as a factory for RedditClients. You give the factory some basic information (a NetworkAdapter,
 * OAuth2 app credentials, etc.) and the factory will produce authenticated RedditClients for you.
 *
 * To use this class we have to make a few assumptions
 *
 * 1. We are using either an "installed" OAuth2 app or a "web" OAuth2 app
 * 2. The given TokenStore will **ONLY** store data for one OAuth2 app
 * 3. The given Credentials are **NOT** for application-only (userless) mode (in other words, make sure to use
 *    [Credentials.installedApp] or [Credentials.webapp] instead of their userless counterparts)
 *
 * From here it's all smooth sailing. You can make use of [switchToUser], [switchToNewUser], and [switchToUserless] with
 * minimal effort. If you ever lose track of the most current [RedditClient], the [reddit] property contains the most
 * recently authenticated RedditClient. Keep in mind that after you use a `switch*` method you won't be able to use the
 * previous client!
 *
 * To use this class to its fullest potential, make sure to provide a [TokenStore] implementation that cache and
 * retrieve OAuthData and refresh tokens for seamless transitions from one account to the next.
